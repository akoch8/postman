# Postman

## What's this?
Postman is a small Chrome extension that allows you to mail the link to the  page you're looking at in your browser to a friend.

## How do I use it?

* **installation**
	- Start by downloading or forking the Postman repository.
	- Next, open your Google Chrome browser and open the extensions page (chrome://extensions).
	- Click "unload unpacked extension√â" and select your Postman directory.
	- Done!

* **usage**
	- The first time you use Postman, it will ask you for your name so that it can use it the mails you send. Then you simply enter someone's e-mail address, click "Run Postman" and your Mail program will open with a pre-composed message ready to send.
	- Postman uses html5 storage to remember your name and the e-mail addresses you enter. The html5 storage can be cleared by clicking "reset" in the lower right corner.
