Postman

Postman is a small Chrome extension that allows you to mail the link to the  page you're looking at in your browser to a friend.
Once you've entered someone's e-mail address Postman will remember it (using html5 storage) and a suggestion box with e-mail addresses will pop up next time you enter one. The html5 storage can be cleared by clicking "reset" in the lower right corner.

So as you can see, nothing too fancy going on here. This was really nothing more than a personal exercise. Feel free to have a look and play around with it!
